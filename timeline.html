      <h3>Tue Aug 01 2023 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)</h3>
      <p>The seeds for BUILD Beyond were sown on August 17th, 2023. That night, over 20 BUILD alumni, staff, and mentors gathered at Stillwater restaurant in downtown Boston, to celebrate the start of a new college term. After a good feast and great conversations, veteran alumni brought down the house with an impromptu panel of advice to the rising college freshmen. And soon a new  alumni community would take root.</p>
