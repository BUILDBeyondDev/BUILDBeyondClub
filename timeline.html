      <h3>August 2023</h3>
      <p>The seeds for BUILD Beyond were sown on August 17th, 2023. That night, over 20 BUILD alumni, staff, and mentors gathered at Stillwater restaurant in downtown Boston, to celebrate the start of a new college term. After a good feast and great conversations, veteran alumni brought down the house with an impromptu panel of advice to the rising college freshmen. And soon a new  alumni community would take root.</p>

      <h3>Fall 2024</h3>
      <p>In Fall 2024, a grassroots working group of BUILD alumni, staff, partners, and board members came together to answer an important question: How can we better recruit, engage, and support BUILD alumni while keeping youth at the center? After several months of collaboration, the group proposed a solution: create a club by alumni, for alumni, designed to connect them with opportunities through BUILD's networks for career success and entrepreneurship.</p>
